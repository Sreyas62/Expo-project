# geminiApp
This project is a React Native-based Chatbot application called "Gemini Chatbot". It utilizes machine learning to generate conversational responses in real-time. The primary goal of the project is to provide users with an interactive chat interface where they can converse with an AI-powered chatbot.

## How it Works ?
### 1. Working of project
   **Real-time Chat Interface :** Users can interact with the chatbot in real-time, typing messages and receiving responses instantly.
   
   **Voice Synthesis:** The chatbot can convert text responses into speech, enabling users to listen to the replies.
   
   **Dynamic Response Generation:** Responses are generated using a machine learning model (Gemini Pro) deployed via an API. The model analyzes the conversation history and generates contextually relevant responses.
   
   **User and Model Roles:** Chat messages are categorized into "user" and "model" roles, distinguishing between user inputs and AI-generated responses.
   
   **Custom Styling:** The chat interface is styled for a modern and user-friendly experience.
